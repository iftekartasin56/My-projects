Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) Calculator - Estimates your basal metabolic rate for your health.

Welcome to our <b>Basal Metabolic Rate Calculator</b>. The basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the amount of energy needed while resting in a temperate environment when the digestive system is inactive. It is the equivalent of figuring out how much gas an idle car consumes while parked. In such a state, energy will be used only to maintain vital organs, which include the heart, brain, kidneys, nervous system, intestines, liver, lungs, sex organs, muscles, and skin.
